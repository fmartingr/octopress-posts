Many of us -or maybe not, but let's assume that- have played at least one *MMORPG* game in our life and we know that it could be *very* time consuming. Level up, going to instances, getting better year… and if you was *hardcore* enough: scheduled raids.

As we grow up we notice that the time for this kind of things fade away, but you still want to party with friends and get some *purples*. Until I found **Tweeria**, that **brilliant idea** of using your twitter posts to interact with your *alter-ego* on a MMORPG world.

It shares some of the features of common MMORPGs but the good part is that **we don't need to do anything else that *tweet*** for many of them, so your character makes an action for every tweet you post -I think it's not every tweet, just a few in a period of time, haven't checked it-. You can defeat *NPCs*, loot an item, going onto a dungeon alone… you can even save -or kill :P-  your friends if you mention or *retweet* them in your tweets.

However, there are some things that needs user interaction: the raids. You can have up to five scheduled raids at the same time but you need to join for it manually. However, it's fast and easy: you just need to get into the events page and join the event you want. For gear swapping, selling items and buying spells you need to interact on the site too. According to the posts you can craft items and spells but that part of the game does not work for me, so I don't know how it works.

Another thing you can do to interact with your character is using spells. For that, you need to buy on the market first, and when you have them equipped, you can cast one by tweeting `!<spell shortcut>` on a given tweet, the game will use it *automagically*. 

Oh, did I mention that also have **achievements**?

As I've said, it surprised me how the most basic idea can be developed into a very enjoyable game. Unlike *ogame*, *travian*, and its brothers, you don't need to check the site every minute.  
But to be honest… I tweet more often since I play *Tweeria*.
