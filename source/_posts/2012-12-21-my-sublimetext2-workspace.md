Essential. Install this and forget about downloading files, updating, ... Choose to use or not every other plugin, but this one is mandatory. Just [install](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) it.

## [Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/)

The best theme I've seen for SublimeText. It's really clean and elegant. Don't forget to use it's custom colors too!

## [Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git) & [GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter)
The first one is a tool to integrate git commands onto the command palette, the second one inserts an icon in the gutter area whether a line has been modified, added or removed.

## [AdvancedNewFile](https://github.com/skuroda/Sublime-AdvancedNewFile)
This is the best. Create a new file just with a key combination, no popups, no nothing. Just press `CMD`+`ALT`+`N`, write the full path -relative to your project path- of the file you want to create and press enter.
