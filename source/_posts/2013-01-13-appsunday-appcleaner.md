If I hate something about uninstalling apps is all the rubbish that is left behind. Windows had that problem and unfortunately OS X have the same curse, but there's some apps that help you removing all that files/folders used for whatever purpose they are. The one that I use its called **AppCleaner** and its freeware.

The interface is really simple, you have two options: Dragging an app or using the list to look for the one we want to remove. Note here that you can drag&drop the app from wherever it is -I mean, from the Applications folder, downloads folder, a pen driveâ€¦- because you may want to remove the configuration files and not the app itself.

When you select an app, a list will show you all the files it have found and you can select what files you want to remove, click the *Delete* button and you are set. Simple as that.

It has been a short *#AppSunday* but you know, the simpler the better ;D.
